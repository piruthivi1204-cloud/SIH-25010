## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
We propose the development and deployment of a Smart Agricultural Advisory System that uses AI, mobile technology, local language support, and real-time data to deliver personalized, actionable, and trustworthy farming advice to smallholder farmers.
Based on crop type, soil conditions, weather, season, and geography.

Covers planting schedules, fertilizer use, irrigation, pest management, and harvesting
Real-time weather forecasting integrated with satellite and API data.

Market price updates for relevant crops from nearby mandis.<li>1.Lack of Access to Reliable, Timely, and Localized Information.2.Low Literacy and Language Barriers.</li>
<li>  Hyper-Localized, AI-Driven Advisory;Innovation: Uses real-time data (weather, soil, pest alerts) and AI models to provide crop-specific, region-specific, and season-specific recommendations.uniqueness:Most advisory services offer general or static advice — this system adapts dynamically to each farmer’s exact conditions.</li></ul>

## Technical Approach

<ul><li>Smartphone Apps: (Android/iOS):
For delivering personalized advice, alerts, weather updates, and visual diagnostics.
IVR: (Interactive Voice Response):
Voice-based advisory systems for low-literacy users, available in native languages.Works even on basic phones (no smartphone needed).

Supports multiple languages (Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, etc.).

Farmers don’t need to read or type → just listen and press keys.

Available 24/7, so they can access advice anytime
</li>
<li>Conduct workshops, interviews, and surveys with farmers, local agronomists, and agricultural institutions to understand real-world challenges and requirements. Gather region-specific agronomic data (soil, climate, pest patterns), existing advisory systems, market dynamics, and government schemes.Choose appropriate technologies (e.g., Android app + SMS + voice support, AI/ML models, cloud services) based on user access and scalability needs.


<ul><li></li>The required technologies—such as mobile apps, AI/ML models, SMS/IVR systems, cloud computing, and IoT devices—are well-developed, cost-effective, and widely available.
<li>Some rural areas still face poor or unreliable network coverage, which can impact real-time data delivery and app usage.Not all farmers have smartphones or are comfortable using digital interfaces. Low digital literacy may hinder adoption.</li>
<li>Poor internet access

Limited smartphone penetration

Low digital literacy.Provide advisory via mobile app, SMS, IVR, and WhatsApp to cater to different device and literacy levels.</li></ul>

## Impact and Benefits
<h3>Increase Productivity: By providing personalized, crop-specific guidance, farmers can adopt best practices that enhance yield and quality.

Reduce Costs: Optimized use of inputs such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides lowers operational costs and reduces waste.

Improve Livelihoods: Better decision-making directly translates into higher incomes and improved food security for farming families.

Promote Sustainability: Access to scientific insights encourages eco-friendly practices, reducing environmental impact and conserving resources.

Enhance Autonomy: Empowering farmers with reliable information reduces dependency on middlemen and promotes self-sufficiency.</h3>
<ul><li>Access to scientific knowledge in native languages builds farmers’ confidence and independence, reducing reliance on inconsistent third-party advice.Exposure to environmentally sound practices encourages long-term soil health, biodiversity, and water conservation.</li>
<li>This helps farmers use water, fertilizer, and pesticides more efficiently, lowering expenses and minimizing waste.Provides timely notifications for pest outbreaks, disease risks, and weather changes, reducing losses and improving preparedness.Reduces reliance on informal or biased advice by providing scientifically-backed, trustworthy information directly.</li></ul>
